----------------

-> Most todo-apps are generally over-engineered, poorly designed, or expensive
-> This todo app made only for me and made open source is extremely simple ("zen") and obviously free. 

-----------------

Functionality: 

-> Add todos 
-> Remove todos 
-> Complete todos
-> Nothing else. 

------------------

Do Your Own: 

-> `clone`
-> `npm install && npm start`
-> `change name title
-> Ready
