# Zen Todo

----------------

-> Most todo-apps are generally over-engineered, poorly designed, or expensive <br /> 
-> This todo app made only for me and made open source is extremely simple ("zen") and obviously free. 

-----------------

Functionality: 

-> Add todos <br /> 
-> Remove todos  <br /> 
-> Complete todos <br /> 
-> Not a single thing more. Just that --Nothing else. <br /> 

------------------

Do Your Own: 

-> `clone` <br /> 
-> `npm install && npm start` <br />
-> `change name title <br /> 
-> Ready <br />
